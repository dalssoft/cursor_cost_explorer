## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Scan usage data to identify 3-5 highest-impact savings opportunities: plan optimization, model migration, error reduction, and cache optimization. Rank by ROI and provide implementation difficulty estimates.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Plan optimization opportunity identified when wrong plan detected
- [ ] #2 Model migration opportunities identified: expensive model overuse with cheaper alternatives suggested
- [ ] #3 Error reduction opportunity identified when error rate >3%
- [ ] #4 Cache optimization opportunity identified when cache rate <75%
- [ ] #5 Opportunities ranked by ROI (high to low)
- [ ] #6 Each opportunity includes: type, title, savings, difficulty (easy/medium/hard), impact (high/medium/low), and action steps
- [ ] #7 Total potential savings calculated and displayed
<!-- AC:END -->
