## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Detect temporal patterns (hourly, daily, weekly), identify work style characteristics (night coder, weekend warrior, sprint worker, steady user), and generate pattern-based recommendations.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Hourly distribution calculated: which hours are most active
- [ ] #2 Daily distribution calculated: which days of week
- [ ] #3 Peak usage times identified: 'Power hours'
- [ ] #4 Sprint detection implemented: unusually high-cost days
- [ ] #5 Work style characteristics identified: night coder, weekend warrior, sprint worker, steady user
- [ ] #6 Pattern-based recommendations generated leveraging detected patterns for optimization
- [ ] #7 User patterns feel personalized, not generic
